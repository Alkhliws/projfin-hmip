Documentation (and functionality) is a bit thin on the ground at the moment,
but basically:

1) mkdir ~/.guml
2) Make a ~/.guml/<umid>.conf file modelled on the provided example.conf
   (see /usr/share/doc/guml/examples/example.conf on Debian systems)
3) Repeat step 2 for each UML image you want to manage.
4) Run guml.
5) Love.
