\begin{abstract}
The investigation of technologies that enable the mobility of terminals in
the Internet has gained a large space in the scientific community. The
solutions for mobility in the network layer, such as Mobile IP and its
derivatives, appear as a transparent and elegant way to deal with the
displacement of a mobile node between subnets. In this work it describes the
implementation of a platform for testing based on UML virtual machines with the
purpose to facilitate studies of these protocols, and implementation of an
experimental version Hierarchical Mobile IP. Also presented are results on the
efficiency and operation of the protocols studied, from the test scenarios
performed on the platform.

\textbf{Keywords:} Mobile IP, Mobile IP Hierarchical, Mobile IP for Linux,
User Mode Linux, Platform of tests.
