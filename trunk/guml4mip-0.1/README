Documentation (and functionality) is a bit thin on the ground at the moment,
but basically:

1) mkdir <directory_scenario>.
2) Make a <umid>.conf file modelled on the provided example.conf
   (see /usr/share/doc/guml4mip/examples/example.conf).
3) Repeat step 2 for each UML image you want to manage.
4) Run guml4mip.
5) In /usr/share/doc/guml4mip/examples have examples of network scenarios
